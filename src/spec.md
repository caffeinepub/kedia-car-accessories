# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the “Visit Our Store” map section to match the provided Google Maps location and expose a clear link to open it.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the “Visit Our Store” section’s map embed (iframe) to display the same store location as https://maps.app.goo.gl/TkMaKv9cUV83vhFXA (replacing the current generic Korba view where feasible).
- Add a clearly visible button/text link in the map section that opens https://maps.app.goo.gl/TkMaKv9cUV83vhFXA in a new tab using `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
- Ensure any newly added user-facing text for this change is in English.

**User-visible outcome:** Users see the correct store location in the “Visit Our Store” map section and can click a prominent link/button to open the exact provided Google Maps URL in a new tab.
